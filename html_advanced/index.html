					<p>Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, and feelings between individuals or groups. It is an essential aspect of human interaction and plays a vital role in various aspects of life, including personal relationships, work, education, and social interactions.

					Effective communication involves not only the transmission of messages but also the understanding of those messages by the intended recipients. It requires the use of verbal and nonverbal cues, such as words, tone of voice, body language, facial expressions, and gestures, to convey meaning and establish a shared understanding.</p>
